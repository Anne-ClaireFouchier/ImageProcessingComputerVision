pgm3d_to_obj.py takes a PGM3D file and outputs OBJ files and a texture file. The number of OBJ files depend on the number of labels you want. 

Run : python3 path/pgm3d_to_obj.py your_path/your_PGM3D_file.pgm3d number_of_labels

If you want to keep the original number of labels, give 0 or below

NOTE : number_of_labels does not include the background.


shepplogan.pgm3d is provided for tests.
